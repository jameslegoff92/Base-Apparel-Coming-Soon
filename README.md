## My process

1. I begin by analyzing both the mobile and desktop design to see how my HTML markup needs to be structured.
2. I divided the project into 5 key components: The header(brand name), image, title, text and form.
3. The next step would consist of seeing if any design patterns are repeated. If so, my css classes need to take these design patterns into consideration.
4. Begin coding using the mobile first approach.
5. End by refactoring my code.


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Floats 
- BEM Methodology
- Sass: mixins and imports.
- Vanilla JS
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Estimated time to complete project: 3 hours.
Actual time to complete project: 6+ hours.
Time spent refactoring: 35mins, 21secs.

The challenge was pretty straight forward, however there were a few moments that slowed down the coding process. Those were. . . 

  1. Getting the svg to move to match the size of the design for both the mobile and desktop.
  2. Converting the mobile design to the desktop design using floats.
  4. Getting the button to have the same style as the design.
